This app is a validator program for validating data inputs against a Campus Labs core data dictionary of expected file and variable types.


Usage:

1. Move an institution core data file inside of 'Desktop/TestCore'
2. Click 'button.bat' (may appear as just 'button')


Output:

The institution core data file will be moved to 'Desktop/VALIDATED_DATA/INSTITUTION_NAME_HERE' with a '`Reports' file inside that contains the validation report for that institution.  A second validation file, 'PersonIdentifier_Report.txt' will also be located in '`Reports' and has info on the 'personID' comparisons against the '`'Accounts/AccountImports/xxx.cxv' file.
